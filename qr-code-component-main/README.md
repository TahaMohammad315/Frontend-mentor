## My process

### Built with

- standard html elements
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

this is the first challenge so there is no much to it just a standard html and css and some flexbox the only new thing i used is css veritables 

here is it:


```css
 :root {
      --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      --grayish-blue: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
      --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
      
      --font-family-default: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
      
      --font-weight-regular: 400;
      --font-weight-bold: 700;
    }
```



### Continued development

i will continue learn more css and bootstrap or tailedwind 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand css variables. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
